    "text": "About us\nWomen in Logic (WiL) aims to provide a forum that brings together women working on logical issues, from foundations of computer science to philosophy, including mathematical logic, logics for AI and logical approaches to language. Our goal is to enhance the experience of women in logic and closely related areas, making achievements of women in logic known to these communities, and thereby increasing the number of women in logic.\nOur flagship event is the annual WiL Workshop.\n\nYou can read about our previous workshops and find links to their individual websites on the workshops page.\nYou can see some of the data we collected showcasing the disregard for women in academia.\nWe appreciate any comments and suggestions that you may have to make this website better: see how to get in touch with us on our contact page.\n\nThank you for all you do to improve the situation for women in logic,\nValeria (for the Steering Committee)"

Conference Organizers should refrain from submitting papers to the Workshop.\nWiL annually requests “in-cooperation status” with the ACM SIGLOG.\nModifications of these bylaws are submitted to the SC Chair and require the approval of the SC.\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen in Logic Steering Committee\n\nThe purpose of the Steering Committee (SC) is to ensure the long-term success of the WiL collective.\nThe SC selects the location, date, and Conference Organizers of each symposium.\nPC and Conference Organizers are just a useful fiction for co-chairs, who divide the work the best way they can.\nThe SC may consist of the PC and Conference Organizers of the last 3 symposia and one member of the SIGLOG executive committee.\nThe SIGLOG representative is appointed by the chair of SIGLOG, subject to approval by the chair of the WiL steering committee, and ensures coordination between SIGLOG and other SIGLOG affiliated events; once every three years when the SIGLOG executive committee changes, the SIGLOG representative may change.\nThe SC elects its own chair shortly after the end of each workshop.\nThe decisions of the SC require at least 50% of the votes and a simple majority.\n\nThe current composition of the SC is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgata Ciabattoni\n\n\n\n\nAppointed until\n\n\n2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexandra Silva\n\n\n\n\nAppointed until\n\n\n2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmy Felty\n\n\n\n\nAppointed until\n\n\n2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrigitte Pienka\n\n\n\n\nAppointed until\n\n\n2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRineke Verbrugge\n\n\n\n\nAppointed until\n\n\n2027\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSandra Alves\n\n\n\n\nAppointed until\n\n\n2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSandra Kiefer\n\n\n\n\nAppointed until\n\n\n2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSara L.
